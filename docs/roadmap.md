## 🔜 v0.51 — v0.60 Roadmap (Next Generation)

### ✅ v0.51 — Plugin System & Custom Detectors
**Status:** Complete | **Release:** v51.0

**What was built:**
- **Plugin Detector Protocol** — JSON-based subprocess protocol for external detectors. Input: JSON on stdin with action, project_root, layers. Output: JSON on stdout with dependencies.
- **`plugins:` config section** — New configuration block for registering external detectors:
  ```yaml
  plugins:
    - name: dart-detector
      command: dart run bin/detect.dart
      languages: [dart]
      timeout: 30s
  ```
- **Plugin lifecycle** — Timeout, error isolation, non-zero exit handling, stderr capture.
- **Capability discovery** — Plugins can advertise name, languages, version via `capabilities` action.
- **3 mock test plugins** — Go-based mock plugin for testing all paths (detect-only, full, slow, error).
- **Documentation** — Authoring guide in Go, Python, and shell script.

**Implementation details:**
- `internal/domain/plugin.go` — `PluginConfig` type with validation (name regex, builtin conflict detection, timeout parsing)
- `internal/domain/protocol.go` — All request/response types (`PluginRequest`, `PluginResponse`, `PluginCapabilities`, etc.)
- `internal/infrastructure/detector/plugin/runner.go` — `RunPlugin()` with `os/exec.CommandContext` for timeout
- `internal/infrastructure/detector/plugin/detector.go` — `PluginDetector` implementing `ports.Detector`
- `internal/infrastructure/detector/registry.go` — `GetPlugins()` and `GetDetectorsForConfig()` updated
- `cmd/arx/root.go` — `newCheckService()` accepts optional config for plugin injection
- `cmd/arx/check.go`, `baseline.go`, `workspace.go`, `server.go` — Updated for plugin support
- `docs/plugins.md` — Full plugin authoring guide
- `test/testdata/plugins/mockplugin.go` — Go-based mock plugin for testing
- `test/integration/plugin_test.go` — Full round-trip integration test

**All 24 tasks completed across 4 phases. All tests pass race-clean.**

---

### 🔲 v0.52 — GitHub Integration & PR Review
**Priority:** High | **Effort:** XL | **Target:** v52.0

**Problem:** Architecture violations discovered post-merge are too late. The highest-leverage intervention point is the pull request — before bad patterns propagate.

**Solution:** A GitHub App that automatically comments on PRs with architecture diff analysis, blocking merges on critical violations while allowing warnings to pass.

**Scope:**
- **`arx pr-check` command** — CLU tool that given a PR diff and base branch, produces a structured report of new, resolved, and unchanged violations.
- **GitHub App** — Webhook receiver for `pull_request` events. Runs `arx pr-check` against the merge commit and posts a check run with annotations.
- **Diff-aware analysis** — Only flag violations introduced by the PR diff lines. Suppress pre-existing violations (already baselined).
- **Check Run API** — Proper GitHub Checks API integration with:
  - **Conclusion:** `success` (no new violations), `neutral` (warnings only), `failure` (new critical violations), `action_required` (needs human review).
  - **Annotations:** Per-violation file annotations on the exact diff lines.
  - **Summary:** Markdown summary with counts, severity breakdown, and trend data.
- **Optional auto-approve** — When all checks pass and no new violations introduced, auto-approve the PR.
- **Configuration** — Per-repo config via `.github/arx-config.yaml` with severity thresholds, auto-approve enable/disable.

**Out of scope:** Inline fix suggestions via GitHub Suggestions API, batch fixing across multiple files.

**Risks:** Rate limits on large PRs (mitigation: sampling or diff-only analysis). False positives on unrelated files (mitigation: diff filtering).

**Dependencies:** v51 (plugin system) — plugin detectors benefit from the same PR-aware pipeline.

---

### ✅ v0.53 — arx LSP (Language Server Protocol)
**Status:** Complete | **Release:** v53.0

**What was built:**
- **Stdlib-only JSON-RPC 2.0** — Hand-written protocol types (Position, Range, Diagnostic, CodeAction, Hover, etc.) with Content-Length header parsing over stdin/stdout. No LSP SDK imports.
- **`arx lsp` command** — Cobra command that wires CheckService, FixEngine, and starts the LSP server. Handles SIGINT/SIGTERM for graceful shutdown.
- **Server state machine** — Initialize → (open/change/close) → Shutdown → Exit lifecycle with proper error codes (-32002 before init, -32600 after shutdown).
- **Document synchronization** — didOpen/didChange/didClose with in-memory document cache.
- **Diagnostic types** — Violation → Diagnostic mapping with severity conversion (error→1, warning→2, info→3, hint→4), source "arx", rule ID as code.
- **Code actions** — Wraps FixEngine.SuggestFix per diagnostic, returns quickfix CodeAction with arx.fix command.
- **Hover provider** — Scans import lines, resolves layer via Layer.MatchesPath, returns markdown with layer name and applicable rules.
- **Config file watching** — Handles workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles for arx.yaml changes.
- **Push diagnostics** — textDocument/publishDiagnostics notification support via PushDiagnostics().
- **Integration test** — Full LSP lifecycle test as subprocess: initialize → didOpen → codeAction → hover → shutdown → exit.
- **All 8 tasks completed** across 5 phases. All tests pass race-clean.

**Implementation details:**
- `internal/infrastructure/lsp/protocol.go` — 350+ lines of LSP + JSON-RPC types, ReadMessage/WriteMessage
- `internal/infrastructure/lsp/server.go` — Server state, initialize/didOpen/didChange/didClose/shutdown/exit
- `internal/infrastructure/lsp/handler.go` — Message dispatcher, method routing, PushDiagnostics
- `internal/infrastructure/lsp/diagnostics.go` — Violation→Diagnostic mapping, severity conversion
- `internal/infrastructure/lsp/codeaction.go` — ComputeCodeActions wrapping FixEngine
- `internal/infrastructure/lsp/hover.go` — ComputeHover, import path extraction, layer resolution
- `cmd/arx/lsp.go` — Cobra command wiring CheckService + FixEngine + Server
- `test/integration/lsp_test.go` — Full lifecycle subprocess integration test

---

### ✅ v0.55 — Policy as Code & WASM Rules
**Priority:** Low | **Effort:** XL | **Completed:** v55.0

**Problem:** YAML-configured rules cover common patterns (cannot-depend, must-depend, circular) but complex organizational policies require arbitrary logic — cross-cutting concerns, data flow validation, custom metrics.

**Solution:** Allow rules to be authored in any language and compiled to WebAssembly, evaluated at native speed with full isolation.

**Scope:**
- ✅ **WASM runtime** — Embedded wazero (pure Go, zero CGO). Each policy is a WASM module exposing an `evaluate() -> i32` function via wazero's runtime.
- ✅ **Policy definition** — New `wasm` field on `Rule`:
  ```yaml
  rules:
    - id: P-01
      wasm:
        path: policies/layer-balance.wasm
        params: { min: 3, max: 8 }
      severity: error
  ```
- ✅ **Host API** — WASM modules import 5 host functions from the `arx` module:
  - `arx_deps() -> i32` — total dependency count.
  - `arx_layer_count() -> i32` — configured layer count.
  - `arx_violation_count() -> i32` — violations from previous phases.
  - `arx_get_dep(idx) -> i64` — dep data as JSON in guest memory.
  - `arx_emit_violation(ptr, len) -> i32` — emit violation JSON from guest.
- ✅ **Cache** — SHA-256 keyed disk cache in `.arx-cache/policies/<hash>/wasm.bin`. In-memory cache via `sync.RWMutex` map. Manager provides singleton evaluators per WASM path.
- ✅ **EvaluateRules Phase 4** — WASM policies evaluated after templates and circular checks. Graceful degradation on errors and timeouts (5s default).
- ✅ **Pre-built reference policies** (TinyGo source + pre-built .wasm):
  - `layer-balance` — Checks deps/layer ratio.
  - `dependency-symmetry` — Checks asymmetry via violations/deps ratio.
  - `no-leak` — Flags deps without any violations.

**Out of scope:** WASM module marketplace, debugger, online editor.

**Risks:** WASM runtime adds a C dependency or performance overhead (mitigation: wazero is pure Go, zero CGO, ~1µs per call). Security: WASM sandbox is naturally isolated.

**Dependencies:** v51 (plugin system proves the extensibility model).

- **Fix C-01 en registry.go** — La última violación de dogfooding que quedó enmascarada. Extraer la lógica compartida a `ports` o reestructurar el registry.
- **Fuzz test corpora final** — Pasar los 13 fuzz tests con `-count=1000` cada uno, sin crashes. Congelar los corpora en el repo.
- **Flaky test pass** — `go test -count=10 -race ./...` pasa sin failures 10/10 veces.
- **Race detector hardening** — `go test -race -count=5 ./...` pasa en CI como gate obligatorio.
- **WASM 1MB size limit** — Implementar el límite de tamaño de módulo que estaba en el spec de v55 pero no se implementó.

**Criterio de éxito:** `go test -count=10 -race ./...` pasa siempre. Cobertura 100% en domain + application. 0 dogfooding violations.

**Criterio de éxito:** Un usuario nuevo puede pasar de 0 a `arx check` funcionando en ≤5 minutos sin preguntar nada.

---

### 🔲 v0.58 — Config Migration & Versioning
**Priority:** 🟡 Media | **Effort:** M

**Qué:** Garantizar que nadie se rompe cuando el schema evoluciona.

**Scope:**
- **`arx config migrate`** — Comando que migra `arx.yaml` entre versiones de schema. Soporta `--to`, `--dry-run`, `--backup`.
- **Migration registry** — Funciones de migración programáticas keyeadas por `(from, to)`. Transforman nodos YAML preservando comentarios.
- **Deprecation warnings** — Cuando se usa un campo deprecado, `arx check` warn ea con la versión en que se va a eliminar y el comando de migración.
- **Schema version endpoint** — `GET /api/config/schema` devuelve la versión activa y las migraciones disponibles.
- **Schema freeze** — El schema v1 queda congelado. Cualquier cambio breaking requiere schema v2 con su migración desde v1.
- **Output contract freeze** — `arx check --json` output se versiona. Se congela v1. Tests que rompen si cambia sin bumpear versión.

**Criterio de éxito:** Un usuario puede migrar de schema v1 a v2 con un solo comando, sin perder datos ni comentarios.

---

### 🔲 v0.59 — Performance Polish
**Priority:** 🟡 Media | **Effort:** S

**Qué:** Publicar baseline de rendimiento, optimizar lo que queda.
